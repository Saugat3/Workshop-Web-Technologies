    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard<br> dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen<br> book.
    <br><br>
    It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.<br> It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with <br>desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
    <br> <br>
    <h1>Where does it come from?</h1>
    Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45<br> BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked<br> up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in<br> classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.
    <ol>
        <li>Lorem Ipsum</li>
        <li>Lorem Ipsum</li>
        <li>Lorem ipsum</li>
    </ol>
    The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and<br> 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by<br> English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
